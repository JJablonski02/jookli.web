        <h3>How JoyProfits uses cookies in advertising</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s
          harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many
          ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with JoyProfits
          to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners, we may use
          cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from seeing the
          same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud, and to
          show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based on
          websites you have visited).
        </p>
        <p>
          We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These server logs
          typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser
          language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies
          that may uniquely identify your browser. We store this data for a
          number of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our
          services and to maintain the security of our systems. We anonymize
          this log data by removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and
          cookie information (after 18 months).
        </p>
        <h4>Our advertising cookies</h4>
        <p>
          To help our partners manage their advertising and websites, we offer
          many products, including AdSense, AdWords, JoyProfits Analytics, and a
          range of DoubleClick-branded services. When you visit a page or see an
          ad that uses one of these products, either on JoyProfits services or
          on other sites and apps, various cookies may be sent to your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          These may be set from a few different domains, including google.com,
          doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com, or googleadservices.com, or
          the domain of our partners’ sites. Some of our advertising products
          enable our partners to use other services in conjunction with ours
          (like an ad measurement and reporting service), and these services may
          send their own cookies to your browser. These cookies will be set from
          their domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          See more detail about the types of cookies used by JoyProfits and our
          partners and how we use them.
        </p>
        <h3>How you can control advertising cookies</h3>
        <p>
          You can use Ads Settings to manage the JoyProfits ads you see and opt
          out of Ads Personalization. Even if you opt out of Ads
          Personalization, you may still see ads based on factors such as your
          general location derived from your IP address, your browser type, and
          your search terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also manage many companies’ cookies used for online
          advertising via the consumer choice tools created under
          self-regulation programs in many countries, such as the US-based
          aboutads.info choices page or the EU-based Your Online Choices.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, you can manage cookies in your web browser.</p>
        <h3>Other technologies used in advertising</h3>
        <p>
          JoyProfits’ advertising systems may use other technologies, including
          Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad formats.
          We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general
          location. We may also select advertising based on information about
          your computer or device, such as your device model, browser type, or
          sensors in your device like the accelerometer.
        </p>
        <h6>Location</h6>
        <p>
          JoyProfits’ ad products may receive or infer information about your
          location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the IP
          address to identify your general location; we may receive precise
          location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your
          search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information
          about your location to us. JoyProfits uses location information in our
          ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the
          relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report
          aggregate statistics to advertisers.
        </p>
        <h4>Advertising identifiers for mobile apps</h4>
        <p>
          To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available
          (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that
          perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes JoyProfits links the
          identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an
          advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads
          across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for
          example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in
          your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to
          our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          To opt out of personalized ads in apps on your mobile device, follow
          the instructions below.

              <li>
                A separate app called <strong>JoyProfits Settings</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                In your main <strong>Settings</strong> app, scroll down and tap{" "}
                <strong>JoyProfits</strong>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

            Switch on <strong>Opt out of interest-based ads</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p />
        <p style={{ color: "#cacaca" }}>iOS</p>
        <p>
          Devices with iOS use Apple’s Advertising Identifier. To learn more
          about your choices for use of this identifier, visit the{" "}
          <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device.
        </p>
        <h6>What determines the ads by JoyProfits that I see?</h6>
        <p>Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.</p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location.
          Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate
          location. So you might see an ad on the homepage of YouTube.com that
          promotes a forthcoming movie in your country, or a search for
          ‘restaurant’ might return results for available restaurants in your
          town.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the ad you see is based on the context of a page. If you’re
          looking at a page of gardening tips, you might see ads for gardening
          equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your app
          activity or activity on JoyProfits services; an in-app ad that’s based
          on your web activity; or an ad based on your activity on another
          device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by JoyProfits but
          selected by another company. For example, you might have registered
          with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given the newspaper,
          it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and it can use
          JoyProfits’ ad serving products to deliver those ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also see ads on JoyProfits products and services, including
          Search, Gmail, and YouTube, based on information, such as your email
          address, that you provided to advertisers and the advertisers then
          shared with JoyProfits.
        </p>
        <h6>Why am I seeing ads by JoyProfits for products I’ve viewed?</h6>
        <p>
          You may see ads for products you previously viewed. Let’s suppose you
          visit a website that sells golf clubs, but you don’t buy those clubs
          on your first visit. The website owner might want to encourage you to
          return and complete your purchase. JoyProfits offers services that let
          website operators target their ads to people who visited their pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this to work, JoyProfits either reads a cookie that’s already in
          your browser or places a cookie in your browser when you visit the
          golfing site (assuming your browser lets this happen).
        </p>
        <p>
          When you visit another site that works with JoyProfits, which may have
          nothing to do with golfing, you might see an ad for those golf clubs.
          That’s because your browser sends JoyProfits the same cookie. In turn,
          we may use that cookie to serve you an ad that could encourage you to
          buy those golf clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your visit to the golfing site may also be used by JoyProfits to show
          you personalized ads when you later search for golf clubs on
          JoyProfits.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit
          advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information,
          such as health information or religious beliefs.
